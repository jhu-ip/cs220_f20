/* 

Demonstrates various error conditions in running the program.
"ugrad> " is the unix command-line prompt in this case.

You can assume that command-line arguments that are supposed to be
numbers (numplayers and stock size) are tested with numbers, not other
data types.  Ie, you don't have to handle that issue, only whether the
values are valid or not.

The main function should return 1 for any error condition, 0 otherwise.
